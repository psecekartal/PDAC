Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most frequent form of pancreatic cancer, poses an increasing disease burden worldwide. Recent evidence suggests a role for the microbiome in PDAC etiology and progression. We analysed the fecal and salivary microbiota in a prospectively recruited population of treatment-na√Øve PDAC patients, chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy controls using shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

The raw sequencing data for the samples are made available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the study identifiers PRJEB38625 and PRJEB42013. Metadata for these samples are available as Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Filtered taxonomic and functional profiles used as input for the statistical modelling pipeline are available in Supplementary Data S1 and S2. 

A repository contains information for pancreatic cancer microbiome-related work.
